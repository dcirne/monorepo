# Monorepo Reference Implementation

This is a reference implementation of a monorepo using an open-source high-level building language and tool, [Bazel](https://bazel.build), to manage and support efficient builds, runs, tests, artifact generation, multiple programming languages, and more. Bazel is multi-platform, multi-language, reliable, scalable, and extensible. It was originally created by Google it is used to manage their own monorepo.

The two key configuration files are `WORKSPACE` and `BUILD`. Each project has their own `WORKSPACE` file that specifies the characteristics and dependencies of that project, plus one or more `BUILD` files that can be located within that project (directory hierarchy), a separate project in a different directory, another repository, or in the internet (third-party, outside dependency).

It is important to understand the fundamental concepts in Bazel: Workspaces, Packages, Targets, and Labels. You can read more in the lexicon of [Concepts and Terminology](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/4.2.1/build-ref.html). When reading or writing the configuration files we want to pay special attention to the definitions of binaries and libraries.

A binary specifies the project you want to build, including dependencies and other parameters. A library specifies a framework or a package to be used by a binary. A binary may have zero, one, or many libraries.


## The Multi-Projects

There are two Python (`anagram` and `calculator`) and one Scala (`fibonacci`) projects in this monorepo. They are all independent from each other and all of them have dependencies on yet another project (`lib`), which provides reusable packages (libraries) for them.

With Bazel it is possible to specify the dependencies and generate builds that only include the necessary files and assets. For example, the `calculator` project includes the `compute` package and also a third-party dependencies. The `calculator` project depends directly only on the `termcolor` package. The `compute` library depends on `lazy-object-proxy` and `pytest`. With Bazel we can specify all that in a very elegant way. Each binary or library only needs to specify what they depend on, in this case `calculator` is not aware of the dependencies `compute` has. They are self contained.


## Bazel in Action

You can choose to install Bazel on your computer, but if you want to jump straight into the action, there is a convenient Docker image that will get you there faster.

Go to the root directory of the monorepo and build the Docker image with:

```bash
docker build --rm . -t monorepo:<x.y.z>
```

Where `<x.y.z>` is a the semantic version of the image, like `0.0.1`. Feel free to use other versioning scheme or label. This image will be build on your machine only. There will be no impact on others. On my machine I build using the following command:

```bash
docker build --rm . -t monorepo:1.0.0
```

Once the image is build, run the image to access the shell, and mount the root of the monorepo to the image's `/workspace` directory:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/workspace monorepo:<x.y.z> /bin/bash
```

Again, `<x.y.z>` is the same label you used to build the image. In my case:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/workspace monorepo:1.0.0 /bin/bash
```


## Building and Running the Anagram Python Project

Now that you have running container with Bazel, let's build and run the first project: _anagram_. In the Docker shell, switch to the `anagram` directory:

```bash
cd /workspace/anagram
```

Build the Bazel project:

```bash
bazel build //src:anagram
```

Understanding what is going on with the command above, we break it down into the following parts:

- `build` -> Command to build the project
- `//` -> The directory in which the `WORKSPACE` file is located (project root)
- `src` -> Relative path from the root directory
- `:` -> Separator between the relative path and the target name
- `anagram` - Target to be built (specified in the BUILD file)

After the build is complete you will see a few new directories:

- `bazel-anagram`
- `bazel-bin`
- `bazel-out`
- `bazel-testlogs`

Those are symbolic links to temporary directories. Anything beginning with `bazel-` is ignored by `git` and the directories themselves can be cleaned with `bazel clean`.

Now it is time to run the project:

```bash
bazel run //src:anagram
```

Alternatively, you can run the project with (it is self-contained):

```bash
./bazel-bin/src/anagram
```


## Building and Running the Calculator Python Project

Switch to the `calculator` directory, build, and run:

```bash
cd /workspace/calculator
bazel build //src:calculator
bazel run //src:calculator
```


## Building and Running the Fibonacci Scala Project

Switch to the `fibonacci` directory, build, and run:

```bash
cd /workspace/fibonacci
bazel build //src:fibonacci
bazel run //src:fibonacci
```


## Running Tests

The main app projects: _anagram_, _calculator_, and _fibonacci_ are bare-bones and lack unit tests. Instead, we will run tests on the libraries those projects depend on. Switch to the `lib` directory:

```bash
cd /workspace/lib
```

And run the tests for the `compute` library:

```bash
bazel test //compute:operators_test
```


## Dependency Graph

It would be nice to visualize a graph with all the dependencies of our projects. And with Bazel we can do just that using the `query` command.

We can see the dependencies in text format:

```bash
bazel query --notool_deps --noimplicit_deps "deps(//src:calculator)"
```

Or we can see if a nice graphical format.

```bash
bazel query --notool_deps --noimplicit_deps "deps(//src:calculator)" --output graph
```

If you do not have `graphviz` installed on your computer, copy the output of the command above and paste it to [Sketchviz](https://sketchviz.com/new) to see the result. It is a pretty picture.


# Documentation in the Code

In addition to what you read here, there is more documentation written in the code. Go explore the files, in particular all the `WORKSPACE` and `BUILD` files. You will find how targets, dependencies, tests, and more were specified.

There is one `WORKSPACE` file for each `anagram`, `calculator`, `fibinacci`, and `lib` projects. Those are the targets that exist in this monorepo. Note that only the first three produce a binary. The last one, `lib` produces only libraries used in the other targets.

If a library is specific to a target, if can be a subdirectory nested under the target's root directory. The intention of `lib` is to provide reusable libraries and frameworks that can be leveraged by multiple projects.


## Containerization

The targets build here can be manually added to a container (e.g., Docker), or that be done automatically by using [Docker Rules for Bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker). Using it is similar to using the rules for Python and Scala (see `WORKSPACE` and `BUILD` files). The result is an image you can deploy to your registry.


## What's Next

There is much more to Bazel that was not covered here. For example, you can specify the output directory for the builds, command line parameters, and much more.

A monorepo without a tool to manage it will become a challenge as it grows.
